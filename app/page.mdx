# Hi.

### My name is Will

Welcome to my page where I share my life 🌴, thoughts 💭, and code 💻.

For anyone who came from this [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Calibre097/featured) , a lot of things have changed: I kept following my passion, and now I
am a Software Developer. If you are interested in my story, I've
shared my story [here](/blog/my-story).
