# Contact ðŸ“¬

### If you wish to contact me, reach me with the email below:

[w@withoutwax.me](mailto:w@withoutwax.me)

I'm currently not open to work, or freelancing. For such emails, I may not respond back.

For other enquiries, if I do not get back to you please do not be offended. I am either in a situation where I cannot check my mail and I will do my best to reply back you.
