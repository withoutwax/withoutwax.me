        How did you start 💻 coding?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6 w-full text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        During my Sophomore year, there was an opening for a class called
        &apos;Object Oriented Programming.&apos; I was curious to know what the
        class was and took it - and it changed my life. Since then, I&apos;ve
        been coding and diving deeper into the world of programming. Now I am
        here!

        How did you meet Jesus?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6 w-full text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        It was year 2021, January 1st, where I was giving new years service. I
        was thinking about stocks, pondering about what is the one ultimate
        investment in life which will never fail and always be profitable. Then
        I thought of Kingdom of Heaven - Matthew 6:19-21 - realizing the most
        profitable thing to invest for was the Kingdom of Heaven. It was a
        moment where Heaven became real to me and decided to jump with leap of
        faith to know more about it. And during that journey, I met Jesus.

        What are you currently doing?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6 w-full text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        Currently, I am working as a Web Developer. I am currently into Web
        Technology 🌐 using JavaScript, React and PHP. I would occasionally do
        some work in Python and C++. At home, I used to work on my side projects
        🕹, build dev tools 🛠 or fun games 👾. But now I pray 🤲🏼, read the Bible
        📖 and worship 👏🏼 and glorify the God ❤️

        I use to have special love for minimalism, technology and the nature 🌱
        I thought to the best thing to do in life was to save the nature and
        make the 🌎 a better place. But I found Jesus and realized he is the
        best way to make the 🌎 a better place.
