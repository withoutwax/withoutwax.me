# About 👨🏻‍💻

Welcome to my about page! I saw you were wondering who I am. Well, let me introduce myself! 😊

### Who are you? 👨🏻‍💻

I am a Christian 🙏🏼 based in South Korea working as a Software Engineer 💻 I have a background in Art and Design 🎨 and I attended School of the Art Institute of Chicago for my Bachelors degree 🎓

### How did you start 💻 coding?

During my Sophomore year, there was an opening for a class called 'Object Oriented Programming.' I was curious to know what the class was and took it - and it changed my life. Since then, I've been coding and diving deeper into the world of programming. Now I am here!

### How did you meet Jesus?

It was year 2021, January 1st, where I was giving new years service. I was thinking about stocks, pondering about what is the one ultimate investment in life which will never fail and always be profitable. Then I thought of Kingdom of Heaven - Matthew 6:19-21 - realizing the most profitable thing to invest for was the Kingdom of Heaven. It was a moment where Heaven became real to me and decided to jump with leap of faith to know more about it. And during that journey, I met Jesus.

### What are you currently doing?

Currently, I am working as a Web Developer. I am currently into Web Technology 🌐 using JavaScript, React and PHP. I would occasionally do some work in Python and C++. At home, I used to work on my side projects 🕹, build dev tools 🛠 or fun games 👾. But now I pray 🤲🏼, read the Bible 📖 and worship 👏🏼 and glorify the God ❤️

### Anything else? 💭

I use to have special love for minimalism, technology and the nature 🌱 I thought to the best thing to do in life was to save the nature and make the 🌎 a better place. But I found Jesus and realized he is the best way to make the 🌎 a better place.

Thanks for visiting! 🙌🏼
