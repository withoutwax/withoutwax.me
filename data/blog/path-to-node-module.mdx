When using some node packages (e.g. - using a Hamburger menu library, by Jonathan Suh) it requires for the developer to link a file which exist in the node module that the package is installed.  

In such cases, by simply adding `~package-name/` will link directly to the package instead of finding the path with `/node_modules/...`.

```scss
// Hamburger Menu - [https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/](https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/)
@import '~hamburgers/_sass/hamburgers/hamburgers.scss';
// @import "../../node_modules/hamburgers/_sass/hamburgers.scss";
```
