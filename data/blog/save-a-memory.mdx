기록을 담다.

During the summer of 2013, a simple idea brought me to some serious contemplation: "Would it be possible to make a record of myself?"

Remember when you are walking down the street, then something came through your mind. Something that you immediately know that this is no ordinary thing. You start to ponder, not knowing where your feet are taking you - don't mind the feet, what is important right now is where you mind is taking you. The simple thought that you had in your mind now starts to engulf you completely. Overwhelmed with the very subject, you are now captivated with the very idea. Every minute, it does not let you go, but promising you with something that is very precious if you follow till the end.

You follow where your thought is taking you. Then you realize.

You have reached the destination. Nobody told you, but you know it instinctively. You see the discovery that was captivating your mind. Now you feel like a different person.

Sometimes thoughts that you had in mind may drove you off somewhere you may never have imagined. Sometimes to expected and unexpected place. Often it is that moment when you do follow the trail and reach the place, you feel something that you cannot explain. A discovery that you wish to share with everyone.

Yet sometimes, you just don't know how you might be able to do that - you may be busy with other things in your life. Maybe too distracted, or even not be bothered to somehow find a way to share this.

I've came across this incident numerous times. I, too, recorded the excitement if I had the note, but sometimes I let it go. After a collection of these discoveries, I wish to put in an archive where all other people can see what I've seen.

Making a record is something not as simple as jotting down an idea, doodling a quick sketch or recording a video - there is much more depth in meaning. It is not simply making a mark, but capturing a soul. I find act of record is no ordinary action, but a very honest and intimate desire of human being.

I always wanted to share the ideas and thoughts that I came across my mind, in wish to help someone, perhaps, the world. I started this blog so that I may be able to do so. I wish I could make this place, a place for my thoughts to dwell, a discovery to other people, an archive of myself. A place of self contemplation in other words.
