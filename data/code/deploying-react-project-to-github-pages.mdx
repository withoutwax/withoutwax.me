While there are many other hosting / publishing methods to host a website, one of my favorite is using GitHub Pages to host my project.

You can also read in more detail about deployment in React [documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment).

### Step 01: Update `package.json`

Add this code to `package.json`

```json
"homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app"
```

It is important to know that we need to use the url generated with GitHub pages.

### Step 02: Install dependency: `gh-pages` & add deploy scripts in `package.json`

While the React documentation uses `npm`, you could also use `yarn` to run the deployment.

```bash
yarn add gh-pages
```

After installing the dependencies, you also need to update the `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {  "predeploy": "npm run build",  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",}
```

Note that the `predeploy` script will run automatically before `deploy` script is run.

### Step 03: Run `yarn deploy`

You are ready. Simply run:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
