When a user adds a new category, assets, taxonomy, etc to their website, it creates a dedicated template page for those lists. However, this sometimes might cause an issue (especially related with SEO) as it generates weird, broken pages that is meaningless by themselves.

One solution to fix this issue is to write a redirect code which can redirect a user to a different, and relevant page.

This can be done by adding a code in either `funtions.php` or any individual templates that are used for such lists, which you want to redirect.

For example underneath, is a code for redirecting any category or tag pages and redirecting them to home (root) page.

```PHP
if ( is_category() || is_tag() ) {
    wp_redirect(get_option('home'), 301);
    exit;
}
```

It is important to understand that you should add `301` as a second argument so that the code returns a 301 which means permanent deletion. This helps Google understand the link is deleted.

For redirecting any taxonomies, or assets or authors, you can use:

```PHP
if ( is_author() || is_tax('sample_taxonomy') ) {
    wp_redirect(get_option('home'), 301);
} elseif ( is_attachment() ) {
    global $post;
	  if ( $post && $post->post_parent ) {
		  wp_redirect( esc_url( get_permalink( $post->post_parent ) ), 301 );
		  exit;
	  } else {
		  wp_redirect( esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ), 301 );
		  exit;
	  }
}
```

If you care considering redirecting any post_type pages:
```PHP
if ( (is_single() && 'sample_post_type' == (get_query_var('post_type')))) {
    wp_redirect(get_option('home'), 301);
    exit;
}
```

Bonus: you can also retrieve current root links with:

```PHP
'https://'.$SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] 
```
