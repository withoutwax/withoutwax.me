```bash
brew unlink php@7.4
brew install php
brew link php
```

You can be specific about which version of php you wish to delete / install.

If `brew link php@whatever-version-installed` does not work, may need to try:

```bash
vi .zshrc
```

This opens vim editor. We need to add following code to the editor:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/opt/php@8.0/bin
```

or

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.1/bin:$PATH"
```

We need to source the file to apply new changes permanently.

```bash
source .zshrc
```

Now try:

```bash
php -v
which php
```
