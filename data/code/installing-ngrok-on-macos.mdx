When I was first introduced with **ngrok** software, I was skeptical at first, but I soon realized the power and potential that it has. **Ngrok** is a software where it allows other people to access your local machine's environment through an internet connection. For example, if I host my localhost:3000 server on my machine and use **ngrok**, **ngrok** gives me a url where I can share to other people so that they can visit and view my localhost:3000.

## 1. Download ngrok.

Downloading can be done in this [site](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started).

## 2.Unzip the zip file that is downloaded.

It is said that you can unzip the file using this script if you are a Linux or Mac users:

```bash
$ unzip /path/to/ngrok.zip
```

## 3. Place the ngrok.exe file into the Application folder

`~/Applications/`

Now, here's a part where it becomes slightly tricky where I actually used a script to install the **ngrok** into my Mac:

```bash
# cd into your local bin directory
$ cd /usr/local/bin

# create symlink
$ ln -s /Applications/ngrok ngrok
```

If this doesn't install **ngrok**, then you can also install by using **brew**:

```bash
$ brew cask install ngrok
```

## 4. Start using ngrok

You can start using **ngrok** by using:

```bash
# For port localhost:3000, you can insert the port number with ngrok:
$ ngrok http 3000
```
