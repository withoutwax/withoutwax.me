When there is `onSubmit="someFunction(this)"` in the the form element:

```html
<form onSubmit="someFunction(this)">
    
    <!-- Some Code -->

</form>
```

The form validation doesn't seem to work properly. However, once the `onSubmit="someFunction(this)"` is gone, the form validation works again.
