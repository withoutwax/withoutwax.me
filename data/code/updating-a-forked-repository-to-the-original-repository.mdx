**1. Add remote with the original repository url - name it "upstream"**

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo/example.git
```

**2. Fetch all the branches and content of remote upstream**

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

**3. Need to rewrite the master with upstream's master using git rebase**

_\- Also need to make sure that you are on the master branch:_ `git checkout master`

```bash
git rebase upstream/master
```

**4. Push the updates to local master (may need `--force`)**

```bash
git push origin master
```
