When building a lightweight website, sometimes you may want to use just plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But in this case, I also wanted to use Tailwindcss as well. Here's a quick tip in setting up a website to use Tailwindcss in native HTML site.

## Parcel

### Install Parcel

I realized in order to use Tailwindcss, a good bundler would be Parcel.

```bash
yarn add parcel-bundler
npm install parcel-bundler
```

### Updated Package.json "scripts"

```json:package.json
// In my case, the entry file was index.html
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "parcel <your entry file>",
    "build": "parcel build <your entry file>"
  }
}
```

## Tailwind

### Install Tailwindcss

In installing the Tailwindcss, I've had some issue with PostCSS plugin requiring PostCSS 8. Thus, I've installed the site with PostCSS 7 compatibility build.

```bash
npm install tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
```

### Create PostCSS Plugin file

```js:postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
    plugins: [require('tailwindcss')],
};
```

### Create tailwind.config.js file

```js:tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

For default build guide, please check the official installation [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

### Add Tailwind to your CSS

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Link your CSS file to your index.html file

```html:index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>DOCUMENT</title>
    <!-- This is a file which contains the Tailwind CSS code which we added in previous step -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- ... -->
  </body>
</html>
```

### Run and build your site with Parcel

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
```

For production, make sure the server is fed through `./dist` folder.
