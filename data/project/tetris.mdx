During my spring Semester, I attempted two huge projects for my finals for Object Orientated Programming course at my school. I planned to create two games entirely from scratch where one is [Snake game](https://withoutwax.me/blog/2017/7/11/snake-game) and the other was Tetris. 

I remembered that creating the Snake Game was challenging but I was able to pull it off - however for the Tetris, I wasn't. 

After the semester ended, I took a break (quite a long break actually) from finishing my Tetris game and last week, I decided to take up the challenge. And finally, I was able to finish building the game 

The game is entirely created from scratch without any external helps. I used Java and Processing IDE to build this game.

\*\*Disclaimer - There is a lag when playing the game as the shapes are moving. I am in process of trying ameliorate this problem for smoother game play.
